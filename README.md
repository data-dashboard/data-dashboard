# Assignment 1

Design 3

## How to run

Run the following commands in the terminal

```bash
npm install

npm run dev
```

## Tech stack used

NextJS (Allows me to generate a static version of the website)

p5.js (for graphs)

CSS

## Note

The graph data is hardcoded for now, but it can be easily brought in via an API call.

p5.js is not the ideal choice for making graphs and I would prefer to use any graphing library instead.

The graphs I made may or may not function well at extreme resolutions.
