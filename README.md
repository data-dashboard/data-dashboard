### Note

- My main focus on this assignment was layout and responsive design. My website works well on a wide range of devices.

- I did not make the grouped graph as I couldn't match it's visual style 1:1, instead, I hardcoded an image.

- Due to time constraints, I'm making the graphs in p5js and embedding the p5js sketch in the page. A better approach would be to use html and css elements.
