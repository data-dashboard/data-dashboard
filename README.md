# Assignment 1

Design 3

## How to run

Run the following commands in the terminal

```bash
npm install

npm run dev
```

## Tech stack used

NextJS (Allows me to generate a static version of the website)

p5.js (for graphs)

CSS

## Note

My main focus on this assignment was layout and responsive design.

The graphs I made do not function well at lower resolutions.

P5.js is not the ideal choice for making graphs and I would prefer to use any graphing library instead, however due to time and design constraints, I'm making the graphs by hand in p5js and embedding the p5js sketch in the page.
